## 2 Stack

### Gameplay:

There are 3 stacks of letters.
The middle stack is a supply of letters.
The side stacks are used to create words.
Move letters from the center stack to the side stacks and try to create words on
them.
Your score is based off how many words you can create within a certain number of
tiles

### Concerns:

- letter generation
 compare both random and predetermined letter generation for difficulty
- consider adding more stacks
